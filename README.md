#Strong Password Generator
//
Will be the basis for a basic strong password generator - The package for generating strong passwords of a length defined by the user and is created as a small introductory project - by no mans, not a real life solution, however, I'm no at the point where I'd be implementing a solution to generate passwords for an authenticator. 

Other libraries exist, such as PyOTP for that.

Features

1. Prompts for required length of password
2. Prompts for number of passwords that should be generated

Incomplete Requirement

1. Strong passwords should be a minimum of 8 and maximumof 16 characters
